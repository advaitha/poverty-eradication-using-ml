# Predicting poverty and wealth from Mobile phone metadata
### Research paper by prof. Joshua Blumenstock
* Mobile phone use reflects the structure of individual's social network, patterns of travel and location choice and histories of consumption and expenditure
* Survey on asset ownership, housing characteristics and other welfare indicators.
* Constructed a composite wealth index
* Mobile phone data is used to predict the wealth index calculated from survey data
* Features constructed are:-
    * Total volume
    * Intensity
    * Timing
    * Direction of communication etc
    * Structure of the individual's contact network
    * Patterns of mobility based on geospatial markers
* Elastic Net regularization was used in modelling
* Geospatial markers in the phone data enabled to study the geographic distribution of subscriber of wealth at an extremely fine degree of spatial granularity
* There was a strong correlation between the mobile metadata predictions and the DHS survey data at district and village levels. Correlations persisted even for comparing clusters within urban and rural areas
* **This approach can be used to predict other metrics as well. Rates of district electrification estimated from phone records are comparable to those reported in the DHS survey**
