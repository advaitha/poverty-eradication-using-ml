# Predicting poverty 


## Approach 1 - Nightitme Lights
### Research by J Neal et al.
* Use Nighttime light values (NLV) as a proxy for poverty
* Dataset provided by Earth Observation Group and Images from Google Static Map at 2.5 Meters of resolution
* Using nightlights as a proxy for development. Nightlights data cannot be directly used because there is less difference in luminosity between rich and poor regions in Africa
* Use Day images which capture more information and use night images as label data. 
* Use transfer learning to learn features from day satellite images and NLV labels
* Train the model and learn important features. These features are calculated for a new image.
* Use these learned features along with survey data at cluster level to train the model.
* As the cluster level data is very less, use simple models
* Use the trained model for classifying new clusters or areas

## Approach 2 - DHS Data & Phone CDR
### Research by Prof.Joshua Blumenstock et al.
* Publicly available satellite-based estimates of poverty are available
* The estimation methods use deep learning models trained on Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from neighbouring countries to estimate the average relative wealth of each 2.4km tile in Togo
* This is used to do cluster level predictions
* Identify the clusters
* Use phone CDR as independent variables and survey data as dependent variable to build models for each household

## Approach 3 - Land Use
### Research by Ayush et al 2020
* Land use and the manufactured objects observed in a satellite image emphasize the wealthiness of an area
* CNN was trained on a land use detection and classification task
* They used xView data consisting of very high resolution images annotated with bounding boxes defined over 10 main classes (building, fixed-wing aircraft, passenger vehicle, truck, railway vehicle, maritime vessel, engineering vehicle, helipad, vehicle lot, construction site) and 60 sub-classes.
* Yolo V3 was used for object detection

## Approach 4 - Tile2Vec
### Research by Jean et al 2019
* Based on Unsupervised learning
* This method emphasizes the difference between two satellite images
* Cluster homogeneous-looking areas and assume that some clusters will be specific to poor areas
