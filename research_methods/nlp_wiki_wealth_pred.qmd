# Predicting Economic Development Using Geolocated wikipedia articles

* Estimate socioeconomic indicators using open-source, geolocated textual information from wikipedia articles
* NLP techniques are used to predict community level asset wealth and education
outcomes using nearby geolocated Wikipedia articles
* Many wikipedia articles are geolocated. Many developing regions of the world contain high concentrations of geolocated articles. These articles contain a rich textual information about locations and entities in an area

## Approach
* Geolocated articles are mapped to a vector representation using **Doc2vec** method
* Use spatial distribution of the embeddings to predict socioeconomic indicators of poverty, as measured by ground-truth survey data collected by the world bank.
* The model is further extended to include information about nightime light intensity as measured by satellites
* This method is able to provide reliable predictions

## Data used
* Asset ownership from DHS
* Corpus of geolocated wikipedia articles. For Africa there were roughly 50,000 such articles.
* Nightlights Imagery from VIIRS

## Methods
* Wikipedia articles consist of a lot of bias in terms of information present, length of articles etc
* Doc2vec model is used to train the embeddings from the documents

## Results
* Wikipedia embedding model outperformed the Nightlight-only model (train and tested within the same country)
* Wikipedia embedding contributes positively towards the predictions
* Multi-modal model performs best in all the different situations
* Results suggest that wikipedia embeddings and nightlight images provide highly complementary information about poverty
